Android Development Pathways
===============

####Introduction



|Key Concepts| Values|
|:------------|:---------|
| **Problem/Solution Based Learning**| In programming there are more ways than one to engineer a solution|
| **Critical Problem Solving**| Students learn how to use multiple tools to solve problems|
| **Critical Management**| Learning when and how to address problems and create automated ways of doing it|
| **Collaboration**| Developers work in teams to conquer large problems sharing work where applicable|

####Getting SetUp

| **No.**| **To Do** |
|:-------------:|:----------|
|**1**| Remix an existing project or start a new one | 
|**2**| Create an account by simply signing up with an email address and password | 
|**3**| Design and execute programs in your browser - no downloads necessary |

####Taking Your Project to the Next Level in the Classroom

Take a project from the [Hour of Code playbook] (http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/hour-of-code.html) and have students follow along.  You can also have students create their own project based on a written prompt that you give them as a literacy test.  Have them break it down into discrete steps (an algorithm) and create a project based on the steps they've written.  Have them assess the end product they made compared to your finished product.  Since there are multiple ways to accomplish a task, have them present their solution to the class.

Debugging code is a very real skill that professional developers have that includes close attendtion to detail and an understanding of syntax.  Create a simple example that has students identify a problem with the function of an app, and debug the code to create a solution.  

Looking for a step beyond?  Try [**Blockly**] (https://code.google.com/p/blockly/) and convert your code into valid Python or JavaScript.
