| **Problem/Solution Based Learning**| In programming there are more ways than one to engineer a solution|
| **Critical Problem Solving**| Students learn how to use multiple tools to solve problems|
| **Critical Management**| Learning when and how to address problems and create automated ways of doing it|
| **Collaboration**| Developers work in teams to conquer large problems sharing work where applicable|

####Getting SetUp

| **No.**| **To Do** |

####Taking Your Project to the Next Level in the Classroom

Take a project from the [Hour of Code playbook] (http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/hour-of-code.html) and have students follow along.  You can also have students create their own solutions based on a problem that you assign them to test their literacy.
