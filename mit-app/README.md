|Key Concepts| Values|
|:------------|:---------|
| **Problem/Solution Based Learning**| In programming there are more ways than one to engineer a solution|
| **Critical Problem Solving**| Students learn how to use multiple tools to solve problems|
| **Critical Management**| Learning when and how to address problems and create automated ways of doing it|
| **Collaboration**| Developers work in teams to conquer large problems sharing work where applicable|

####Getting SetUp

| **No.**| **To Do** |
|:-------------:|:----------|
|**2**| Create a Google account for students | 
|**2**| Log into the browser-based editor | 
|**1**| [Install and run an Android Emulator] (http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-emulator.html) Note: It can take several minutes for the emulator to launch and run.  Launch at the beginning of class to save time |

####Taking Your Project to the Next Level in the Classroom

Take a project from the [Hour of Code playbook] (http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/hour-of-code.html) and have students follow along.  You can also have students create their own project based on a written prompt that you give them as a literacy test.  Have them break it down into discrete steps (an algorithm) and create based on the steps they've written.  Have them assess the end product they made compared your finished product.  Since there are multiple ways to accomplish a task, have them present their solution to the class.
