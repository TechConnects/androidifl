Android Programming Foundations
===============

####Introduction 

Moving beyond the Scracth-like MIT App inventor is intimidating, but it will allow for more flexibility and more ultimately more of an ipportunity to develop a highly necessary skill. 

Installation for the Software Development Kit (SDK) will vary from machine, but is luckily bundled with easy installer.  See the [Resources] (https://github.com/TechConnects/androidifl#resources) from the main folder for instillation.  

Working within an IDE will will allow students to build skills in Java programming and allow them to learn screen layouts with XML (Extensible Markup Language).  Java is a demanding programming language which requires students to have the ability to solve multiple problems by using a variety of tools.
