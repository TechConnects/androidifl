Android Programming Foundations
===============

####Introduction 

Moving beyond the Scracth-like MIT App Inventor is intimidating, but it will allow for more flexibility and ultimately more of an opportunity to develop a highly demanded skill. 

Installation for the Software Development Kit (SDK) will vary from machine, but is luckily bundled with easy installer.  See the [Resources] (https://github.com/TechConnects/androidifl#resources) from the main folder for instillation instructions.  NOTE: you may need to work with an IT professional from your school.    

Working within an IDE will will allow students to build skills in Java programming and allow them to learn screen layouts with XML (Extensible Markup Language).  Java is a demanding programming language which requires students to have the ability to solve multiple problems by using a variety of tools.  


|**Project Workflow**| Description |
|:-------------------|:------------|
|Starting a project  | Use the Android SDK to create a new simple app project. |
|Add user input      | Add a customized button with text, and set it to perform a simple function. |  
| Testing            | Test your new app with an Android emulator to see your product in action | 

####Taking Your Project to the Next Level

Implementing the project in your classroom will allow students to flex their creative muscles and start learning Java.  Are you not a fulltime Java developer with years of experience?  Don't worry, try having your students follow along with the [Treehouse project] (http://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-simple-android-app) to create a simple app.  

For more information on Java, see there Java Basics for Android Parts [1] (http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/java-basics-for-android-development-part-1) and [2] (http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/java-basics-for-android-development-part-2).

####Goals and Assessment

Be sure to set realistic goals for your students.  Programming is difficult, but much can be accomplished with a little work.  

Debugging code is a very real skill that professional developers have that includes close attention to detail and an understanding of syntax.  Create a simple example that has students identify a problem with the function of an app, and debug the code to create a soltuion.
